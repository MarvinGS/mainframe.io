##### History
The very first meeting that was to lead to the founding of a hackspace took place at Marvin's at the beginning of 2011. After an unexpectedly large number of people came to the meeting planned at short notice, a regular weekly meeting was arranged.

In July 2011, the non-profit association Kreativität trifft Technik (Creativity Meets Technology) was finally founded to serve as the supporting association for the hackspace. As there was initially still a lack of premises, the regular meetings continued to take place at Marvin's and/or Beppo.

To bridge the time until the first premises were ready, we organized three events lasting several days, which were called alpha. These were a kind of preliminary version of the hackspace.

At the beginning of November 2011, the hackspace found a permanent home for the first time. This space was initially named Betaspace in reference to the alphas. It was located in the rooms of the Kulturetage and was initially open once a week, eventually opening daily.

As the Kulturetage building was demolished at the end of 2012, the space moved to Raiffeisenstraße 27. Initially around 80m² was rented there. Due to the growing number of members, this was extended to the entire first floor (approx. 200m²) by the end of 2013.

Just one year later (2014), a further move was made to Bahnhofsplatz 10, where an incredible 600m² are available. The premises were previously used by Deutsche Post for mail sorting machines and are located in the immediate vicinity of the train station.
