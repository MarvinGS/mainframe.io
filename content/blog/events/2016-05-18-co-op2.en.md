On May 14/15, our upcoming hackathon, the co-op2, took place at Hackspace. This time it was all about the Spacebus
which sends events via [MQTT](https://mqtt.org). This bus had already been used
used to collect temperature and electricity meter values, but there was even greater potential in the use of sensors and
actuators. The aim of the event was to learn how to use MQTT together and to build cool projects from it, which ideally
also offer the Space a functional extension.

We learned from the [co-op1](@/blog/events/2016-02-08-co-op1.en.md) that participants can show up at very different times
on Saturdays and
different times on Saturdays and have therefore started with a soft opening. Between 10 and 20
people were busy in the Space over the weekend, working on useful and impressive projects.

This time, the projects were more in the software sector, but here and there an ESP was also installed as an actuator or
sensor to extend the bus functions. The projects included, for example, a group that persists the events of the
MQTT bus and visualized them with [Grafana](https://grafana.org). There you can now, for example, see the
current power consumption and the number of space visitors, as well as the history of the past weeks. The
reading of the power consumption has also been repaired and improved.

Another group built a space switch for our bicycle workshop, the so-called Radstelle. This can be used in the status of
the spatially separated workshop and can be called up as a status via the homepage.

and planned by another participant. prepared and planned.

Also impressive was the expansion of our [Space Map](http://map.ktt-ol.de/), in which our power consumption and opening
status can now be
power consumption and the opening status can now be rendered and displayed live in an SVG. This lays the foundation for
integration of further sensors.

Our guests, some of whom were very young and had traveled from Hamburg, have now, for the life of them, installed our
mainframe in Minecraft and demonstrated an incredible attention to detail.
and demonstrated incredible attention to detail. Using various plugins and tricks, the MQTT bus could then be redirected
into the game, and it was possible, for example, to display the opening status of the mainframe live in the game. Even
the live display of the visualization group was shown on a virtual screen. on a virtual screen.

Other participants also simply extended and improved the code of their existing MQTT projects, generally supported other

All in all, a very pleasant and constructive atmosphere prevailed in the Space, which was further enhanced with soup on
Saturday evening and an all-day breakfast on Sunday.

Another result of the hackathon
is [a collection of code snippets for the ESP8266 with MQTT connection](https://github.com/ktt-ol/esp-mqtt-nodes), which
makes it easier for other members to connect their own sensors to the Spacebus.

At the finale, of course, there was again an evaluation of the individual projects, which were then awarded great
prizes. Our sponsors [O'Reilly](http://www.oreilly.de/), [dpunkt-Verlag](http://www.dpunkt.de/),
[watterott](http://www.watterott.com/) and [getdigital](https://www.getdigital.de/) once again supported us with books
and papercraft models. Many thanks for this at this point!

Many thanks also to all those who supported and helped with the organization of the event. We are already
to the next one!
