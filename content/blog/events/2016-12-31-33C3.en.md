#### 33C3

Of course, the mainframe will also be represented at this year's Chaos Communication
Congress this year. Information about our [Assembly can be found directly in the 33C3 Wiki](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2016/wiki/Assembly:Mainframe).
This year we will probably be there with over 20 people, about half of whom will arrive on Boxing Day.
Christmas Day. Among other things, we are planning a workshop for MQTT
based refrigerator monitoring.

For this reason, from 26.12.2016 to 30.12.2016 with
reduced opening hours of the mainframe.
