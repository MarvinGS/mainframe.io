Pinte42 was exactly the right place for our third Alpha. The presentations
could be held in a separate room in peace and quiet and the proximity to the
students brought in one or two random guests ;)

The main attraction was once again the 3D printer we had been loaned.
3D printer.
On day three, we were even able to get it to print club logos out of plastic
(ABS) to print club logos.

The presentations on "Legal pitfalls in social media" and
"Bit-Twiddling" were well attended. The same applies to the workshops on offer on getting started with Arduino, for
example. On the evening of the third day, the great rush of visitors had even triggered the Matecalypse - the entire 70
liters
were drunk ;)

Nevertheless, we worked on all kinds of projects until late on Sunday and taught interested parties how to solder. The
club has gained five new members and
many new friends. The Alpha was a complete success!
