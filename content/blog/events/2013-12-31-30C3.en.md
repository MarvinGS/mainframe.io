#### 30C3
This year, a whole delegation from the Oldenburg Hackspace officially attended 30C3. We had our usual exhibits (3D printer, LED cube) and put up a banner in the Hackcenter.

Apart from that, we just enjoyed the time together with the other hackers, visited the ball pool and listened to the talks.

Summary: We will be back in Hamburg in 2014, probably with an even larger delegation.
