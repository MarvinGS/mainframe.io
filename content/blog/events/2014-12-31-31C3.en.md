As already announced after 30C3, we were once again at this year's
Chaos Communication Congress - this time with over twenty people. In
last year, we were not in the Hackcenter this year, but in the Quiet Area
in the Quiet Area (and thus somewhat more secluded). But there was
enough space for banners, a JoSeb (3D printer), a fat
LED ticker, our mainframe sign and a few small items.

Apart from that, we simply enjoyed our time together with the other hackers,
visited the ball pool, listened to the talks and looked at the installations of other
spaces.

Resume: CCCamp here we come!
