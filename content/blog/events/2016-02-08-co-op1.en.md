The theme of co-op1 was "waiting list projects". Everyone knows it, that one project that has been tempting you for
ages, but you never take the time to do it. This kick-off event was designed to tackle precisely these projects. For
participants without such a project
a [list of Space projects](https://pad.kreativitaet-trifft-technik.de/p/Spaceprojekte), which were collected
on the Space waiting list.

Around 15 participants gathered in the mainframe in addition to the regular Space operation and first presented their
project ideas in the lounge. their project ideas in the lounge. The project groups then came together, some of whom had
already arranged to meet beforehand. had already arranged to meet beforehand. Since many ESP8266 projects were on the
waiting lists of the participants, but the necessary know-how was not sufficiently available, an ESP-experienced
participant agreed to give a short crash course in the hardware.

From then on, they worked diligently on the projects throughout the space. As the participants mainly worked on
electronics projects, the Ersa soldering stations sponsored by [Watterott](https://www.watterott.com) were very helpful
to enable all participants to work simultaneously. to enable all participants to work simultaneously. At regular
intervals, the participants gathered again in the lounge to report on project progress and problems. For example, laser
operators were also referred to projects who still needed a housing for their circuit board.

At 20:00, we had dinner together and then worked late into the night. Among other things that it didn't fill up until
the afternoon on Sunday and we postponed the planned end of the event by two hours to 20:00 postponed by two hours to

days.

At the end of the event, all the projects were presented once again, even if some of them were not quite finished that
evening. not quite finished that evening. For example, we had received new ambient lighting for our outdoor area, which
can be controlled via can be controlled via WLAN. Other space projects included work on a new locking system, the
comprehensive recording of space temperature and humidity, a prototype for a cell phone charging station and the revival
of decommissioned subsidiary station clock. station clock and a Space status display for the conference room. Other
participants have developed new technologies, namely MQTT and Perl6, and implemented small software experiments with
them. Also, an audio multiplexer with 8 inputs and 8 outputs was also among the waiting list projects.

Each participant now had the opportunity to give their three favorite projects one vote each in the form of a laser-cut
voting token. The number of tokens received per project then determined the order in which the participants could choose
their prize. These non-cash prizes were kindly provided by other sponsors. [O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.de/)
and [dpunkt Verlag](https://www.dpunkt.de/) sent us a joint book package and sent us a joint book package
and [getdigital](https://www.getdigital.de/) contributed a kit for a Da Vinci catapult.
