#### co-op3: Your project for the congress

![](/media/blog/events/co-op3/co-op3-logo.jpg)

The co-op3 hackathon took place on the weekend of November 05 + 06, 2016 at the Mainframe. The motto was: Your project for the [Congress - 33C3](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2016/wiki/Main_Page)The focus was on projects that could be brought to 33C3.

After the start at 4 p.m. on Saturday, the participants competed with their project ideas. As with the previous hackathon [co-op2](@/blog/events/2016-02-08-co-op1.md)/[coop2](@/blog/events/2016-05-18-co-op2.md), the event began with a soft opening. The activities took place throughout the entire space. After an initial round of introductions, people met in the lounge at regular intervals to discuss progress and any problems encountered along the way - so-called "syncs". A total of 10 people took part and there were also spontaneous participants who used the event as an opportunity to take a closer look at their other projects.

With so much thinking and tinkering, food was of course a must and so on Saturday evening there were hot dogs to eat (vegetarian too, thank you!).

Work was carried out on the following projects, among others:

* Readout of smartphone sensors and visualization using ESP8266 and WS2812 LEDs
* Circuit for detecting the ringing voltage of a field telephone with ESP8266 and forwarding it to the MQTT server
* Transport protection for the LED panel, improvement of the snake game
* Volume level display with Teensy 3.1, Audioshield and WS2812
* Solder vapor extraction and flashing fir tree
* Fading and flashing support for I2C support of the locking system
* Visual alarm via wallwasher with bus protocol
* Badge for the space and pong with the robot arm
* Interactive LED ticker with WS2812 and ESP8266

We worked on the projects until early in the morning. More or less well-rested, the work continued on Sunday at 2 pm after a joint breakfast. The participants worked meticulously on their projects until the very last minute. In between, there was more and more to see - everything gradually took shape. The results were then presented at a final meeting, followed by an awards ceremony.

Our sponsors [O'Reilly](http://www.oreilly.de/), [dpunkt-Verlag](http://www.dpunkt.de/), [watterott](http://www.watterott.com/)and [getdigital](https://www.getdigital.de/) have once again supported us with books and electronics. Many thanks for that! Among the prizes were books and electronic kits.

This was a great end to a really successful hackathon weekend. Many thanks at this point also to the organizers Jan Janssen, Oliver Tonhofer, Michael Pensler!

We look forward to the next hackathon!
