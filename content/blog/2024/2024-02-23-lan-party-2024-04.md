We continue our tradition and are happy to announce we will host the next installment of our famous LAN party for the
computer science students of the university of Oldenburg.

By now you should be somehow familiar with the process of registration.

For the greenhorns however are here the most important points.

The registration is now open until 23.03.2024.
Tickets are meant to be planning tickets. They cost you 0.00€. However, they help us immensely in planning the event.

We don't need any personal information (aside from a working mail address). We only ask to handle this like a regular
ticket you paid money for, meaning you only order if you really plan on attending and cancel in case you can't make it.
That way we are able to plan more precisely and everybody wins. Thank you!

We might send out some mails in case of last minute changes.
Be assured you will only receive mails related to this event, if any. We despise SPAM as much as you do.

All data will be destroyed after the event!

Read the FAQ first and then go to [https://tickets.mainframe.io](https://tickets.mainframe.io) and order your ticket.

Thank you

# Parking

There is free parking on the street from 19:00 until 08:00 the next day. 60ct/30min from 08:00 - 19:00.   
The parking spot towards the train station is operated around the clock and not free. You should probably avoid that
one. There is another parking spot under the building. This one is free the first 30min. After that it costs 1€/h. Max is
5€/day. However, we don't know what the trigger for the day is. Maybe 24 hours. Maybe midnight. We don't know. You do
need EC-Cash for that.

# Sleeping

For short napping we offer some couches.
We do not offer full sleeping capabilities.
